You can use the approximate mole fraction of cyclohexane, along with the literature data given in Reference 1 of your Procedure handout (available on D2L), to estimate a total pressure above the solution at each of your approximate compositions. Use this in the experiment to set the pressure to roughly where you expect to see the solution boil, wait for it to stabilize, and then adjust the pressure accordingly. Bear in mind that you will need to ADD the pressures $p_A$ and $p_B$ in the literature data table to obtain the TOTAL pressure above the solution."
